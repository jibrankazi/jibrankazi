## 🧠 Research Vision  
I’m driven by one question: **How can AI systems reason, adapt, and explain with the same rigour that they predict and generate?**  

My work integrates **Causal Inference**, **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to build transparent and reproducible AI systems.  
I’m passionate about creating models that are **interpretable, data-grounded, and ethically deployable**.

## 🎯 Research Fit  
My doctoral research goal is to advance **interpretable, causally grounded generative AI** — systems that can explain and justify their reasoning.  
At the **University of Toronto**, I aim to work under the guidance of **Professors Sheila McIlraith, Jimmy Ba, Rahul Krishnan, and Alán Aspuru-Guzik**, whose research aligns directly with my technical and scientific interests.
